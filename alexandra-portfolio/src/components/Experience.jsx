          Hello, my name is Alexandra. Since 2019, I have been working as a
          supervisor in parental education for the HoltIS Association. All the
          projects I have been involved in have been carried out in collaboration
          with UNICEF. Among these, one of the key initiatives I contributed to
          was the establishment of HoltIS youth clubs in 140 schools nationwide,
          supporting both middle and high school students.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about painting, music, technology and always open to
          new discoveries. I find motivation in challenges that promote
          continuous learning and personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly value fairplay and believe in both offering and receiving
          respect. For me, mutual respect, integrity, and collaboration are
          essential in creating meaningful connections and a positive environment.
